# Evaluation Methodology

## Objectives
- Measure detection accuracy under realistic conditions
- Evaluate false positive behavior
- Assess system performance and overhead

## Baselines
- Rule-only detection
- ML-only anomaly scoring
- Hybrid approach

## Environment
- Raspberry Pi 4 sensors
- Commodity Wi-Fi adapters
- Isolated lab networks

## Metrics
- Precision, recall, F1
- False positive rate
- Detection latency
- Resource consumption
