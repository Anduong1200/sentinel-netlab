# Responsible Use Policy

## 1. Educational Purpose
Sentinel NetLab is designed to teach students and researchers about:
- 802.11 Protocol Weaknesses (Management frames are unauthenticated).
- Detection logic for wireless attacks.
- Secure system architecture.

## 2. Defensive Focus
All offensive capabilities (e.g., Replay Test Vectors) exist **solely** to validate the detection logic. They should never be used against operational networks where disruption could cause harm.

## 3. Vulnerability Disclosure
If you discover a security vulnerability in Sentinel NetLab itself (e.g., RCE in the Controller):
- **Do not** open a public GitHub issue.
- **Do**: Email the maintainers directly or use GitHub Private Reporting.
- We pledge to address critical issues within 90 days.
