# Case Study: Optimal Security vs Usability in Wireless Defense

> **Abstract**: This study explores the trade-offs between aggressive wireless intrusion detection settings and network usability using the Sentinel NetLab platform. We analyze false positive rates in mixed-use environments and propose a tuned configuration for optimal balance.

## 1. Introduction

Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS) often suffer from high false positive rates, leading to "alert fatigue." Aggressive detection of deauth/disassociation frames or "Evil Twin" characteristics can trigger alerts on legitimate roaming behaviors or poor signal conditions.

## 2. Methodology

We deployed Sentinel NetLab sensors in two distinct environments:
- **Environment A (The Lab)**: Controlled, low-noise RF environment.
- **Environment B (The Office)**: High-density, multi-AP, BYOD environment.

### Metrics
- **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: % of alerts generated by benign activity.
- **Mean Time To Detect (MTTD)**: Time from attack start to alert.
- **Usability Index**: Inverse of user complaints regarding connectivity interruptions (for IPS).

## 3. Experiments

### 3.1 Default Configuration (Aggressive)
- Risk Threshold: 40
- Deauth Rate: 5/sec
- RSSI Delta: 10dB

**Result**: High sensitivity but excessive noise in Office environment (roaming triggered Deauth alerts).

### 3.2 Tuned Configuration (Optimal)
Using `tools/tune_detection.py`, we optimized weights based on labeled benign data from Environment B.

- **Risk Threshold**: 65
- **Deauth Rate**: 20/sec (burst tolerance)
- **Weights**:
  - Encryption: 0.5 (High importance)
  - RSSI Norm: 0.1 (Lowered due to multipath)
  - Vendor Trust: 0.2

## 4. Findings

| Metric | Aggressive | Tuned (Optimal) |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Detection Rate | 98% | 94% |
| False Positives (24h) | 142 | 3 |
| Usability Impact | High | Low |

## 5. Conclusion

For "Usable Security," context is key. Pure anomaly detection fails in chaotic RF environments without stringent filtering. The hybrid approach (Signature + Risk Score) with site-specific tuning provides the best compromise.

**Recommendation**: Start deployment in "Learning Mode" (Active Defense disabled) for 72h to establish baselines before enabling enforcement.
