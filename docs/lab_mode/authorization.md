# Authorization Model

To ensure ethical use, Sentinel NetLab enforces a strict authorization model for "Active" and "Research" features.

## 1. The Authorization Token
- **Concept**: A distinct "Research Token" is required to enable Lab Mode features.
- **Issuance**: Generated by the Faculty/Admin and physically provided to the researcher.
- **Scope**: Tied to specific sensors and time windows.

## 2. Policy Enforcement point (PEP)
The **Controller** acts as the PEP.

1. Sensor requests config update to enable `raw_capture`.
2. Controller checks `research_token` validity and `research_approved` flag in DB.
3. If valid, Controller sends signed config to Sensor.
4. Sensor verifies signature before applying.

## 3. Audit Trail
All Lab Mode activities are logged to a tamper-evident audit log (`audit.log` or centralized logging).
- **Who**: Researcher ID.
- **When**: Start/Stop times.
- **What**: Configuration changes (e.g., "Enabled PCAP storage").
- **Why**: Linked Research Protocol ID.
