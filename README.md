**Sentinel NetLab** is a **Lightweight Wireless Network Monitoring and Anomaly Detection System** designed to **automate and orchestrate** security assessment tasks. It serves as an operational layer above standard tools (like Tshark/Aircrack-ng), providing continuous monitoring, centralized logging, and risk scoring for SMEs and Research Labs.

> **Note:** This project does not aim to replace deep analysis tools like Wireshark, nor does it focus on breaking encryption. Its core value lies in **operational visibility** and **posture assessment**.

---

## 🚀 Key Objectives

- **Orchestration**: Automate the capture-analyze-alert loop 24/7 without human intervention.
- **Posture Assessment**: Detect misconfigurations (Shadow IT, Rogue APs) and behavioral anomalies.
- **Cost-Effective Visibility**: Provide WIDS capabilities for environments that cannot afford enterprise appliances.
- **Real-time Forensics**: Automated PCAP analysis and attack signature detection.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support for distributed sensors with centralized aggregation (Prometheus/ELK stack ready).
- **Active Defense**: Deauthentication containment capabilities (controlled environment only).
